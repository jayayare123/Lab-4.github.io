
BACKGROUND IMAGE:
Now we want to have a background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times.

The requirements are as follows:

Fill the entire page with the image (no white space)
Scale image as needed
Center image on page
Do not cause scrollbars
The following example shows how to do it; Use the <html> element (the <html> element is always at least the height of the browser window). Then set a fixed and centered background on it
